# 42_basecamp

These may not be the best codes you'll find out there but they work (with only 2 or 3 exceptions) haha
It was my very first experience coding and I'm very proud of what I accomplished in only 20 days with little guidance but infinite support from the 42 community.
I can't wait for what's coming!
